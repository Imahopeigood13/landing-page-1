          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Hello my name is Tamir Ahmed. I recently graduated from Thomas A.
            Edison Career and Technical Education High School, where I studied
            Information Technology. This inspired me to continue learning and
            now I am an upcoming student at Baruch college where I plan to study
            Computer information systems. And at the moment I am doing my best
            to learn coding and more about IT to become great at the field.
          </p>
          <h2>Personal</h2>
          <p>
            I am someone who tries to stay active and engaged in various
            subjects. I enjoy going to the gym regularly to maintain my physical
            health and well-being. Spending quality time with friends and family
            is also important to me as it helps strengthen my relationships and
            provides a sense of community. I also love playing soccer, which not
            only keeps me physically active but also teaches teamwork and
            strategic thinking. Additionally, I have a passion for learning new
            things and exploring a wide range of topics, from technology and
            science to art and culture. This diverse set of interests keeps me
            curious and constantly growing, both personally and professionally.
          </p>
          <h2>Skills</h2>
          <p>
            I have many set of skills in the Information Technology field. I am
            proficient in troubleshooting computers, identifying hardware
            components, and assembling a PC from individual parts. Additionally,
            I have a foundational knowledge of several programming languages,
            and I am actively learning more to be proficient in this skill. My
            skills also extend to network configuration and basic cybersecurity
            principles, which I have developed through both formal education and
            hands-on experience.
